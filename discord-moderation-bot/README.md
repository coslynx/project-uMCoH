# Discord Moderation Bot

This project aims to develop a Discord moderation bot to efficiently manage a server by providing automated moderation features to maintain server order and enforce rules.

## Key Features

- **Auto-mute:** Automatically mutes users who spam or use inappropriate language.
- **Auto-kick:** Automatically kicks users who violate server rules consistently.
- **Auto-ban:** Automatically bans users who engage in severe violations or repeat offenses.
- **Customizable commands:** Allow server admins to set custom moderation commands.
- **Warning system:** Issue warnings to users before taking automated moderation actions.
- **Logging:** Log all moderation actions taken by the bot for transparency.
- **Role management:** Allow admins to assign roles and permissions through the bot.
- **Scheduled moderation tasks:** Schedule specific moderation tasks to run at designated times.
- **User reporting:** Allow users to report rule violations to the bot for review.
- **Anti-raid protection:** Implement measures to prevent server raids and spam attacks.

## Enhancements

- **Integrate machine learning algorithms:** for more accurate detection of rule violations.
- **Implement a user-friendly dashboard:** for easier bot configuration and monitoring.
- **User activity tracking:** Add a feature to track user activity and behavior patterns for better moderation decisions.
- **Language filter:** Incorporate a language filter to automatically detect and filter out inappropriate language.
- **Custom moderation rules:** Include a feature for server admins to create custom moderation rules based on their server's specific needs.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Languages:** Python for backend development, JavaScript for Discord bot integration.
- **Discord API:** Discord.py library for interacting with the Discord API to create and manage bots.
- **Machine Learning API:** TensorFlow for implementing machine learning algorithms for rule violation detection.
- **Dashboard API:** React.js for building a user-friendly web dashboard for bot configuration and monitoring.
- **Language Filter API:** Google Perspective API for detecting and filtering inappropriate language.
- **Packages:** 
  - discord.py (Latest version: 1.7.3) for Discord bot functionality.
  - TensorFlow (Latest version: 2.6.0) for machine learning capabilities.
  - React.js (Latest version: 17.0.2) for building the dashboard interface.
  - google-perspectiveapi (Latest version: 1.0.0) for integrating the language filter.

## Rationale
